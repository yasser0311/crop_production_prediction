# Crop Production Prediction
This project analyzes agricultural data to predict crop production by examining key factors such as area harvested, crop types, and regional variations. It utilizes data visualization and machine learning models (regression) to provide accurate predictions and insights.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Analyze Crop Distribution
- **Crop Types**: We analyze the `Item` column to identify the most and least cultivated crops across regions using a Plotly bar chart.
- **Geographical Distribution**: This process analyzes the `Area` column to identify the areas that specialize in specific crops or have high agricultural activity using the `scatter_geo` chart.

### Temporal Analysis
- **Yearly Trends & Growth Analysis**: This process involves analyzing the `Year` column to detect trends in Area Harvested, Yield, and Production over time, as well as identifying growth patterns in specific regions using a line chart.

### Input-Output Relationships
- In this process, using a Seaborn heatmap chart, the correlation between Area Harvested, Yield, and Production has been analyzed.

### Comparative Analysis
- **Across Crops**: This process focuses on comparing the Yield of different crops (from the `Item` column) to identify high-yield and low-yield crops using a bar chart.
- **Across Regions**: This process focuses on comparing Production across different regions to identify highly productive regions using a bar chart.
- **Productivity Analysis**: This analysis focuses on examining Yield variations to identify high-yield crops and productive regions.

### Outliers Detection
- In this process, outliers present in the Area Harvested, Yield, and Production columns were filtered and stored in a variable. All the values are a part of the whole process because these values are correlated between each column.
